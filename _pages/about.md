Welcome! I am a PhD student working under the supervision of Dr Julie Grèzes and Dr Lou Safra. My doctoral project aims to elucidate the cognitive mechanisms generating and controlling implicit race and gender biases. We combine behavioral, physiological, and computational analyses to address this societally relevant research question and hope to eventually inform empirically-rooted anti-bias interventions.

I hold a double masters in Cognitive Neuroscience awarded from [University College London (UCL)]([url](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/)), [Sorbonne University]([url](https://www.sorbonne-universite.fr/en)), and [Ecole Normale Supérieure]([url](https://www.ens.psl.eu/)), as well as a Bachelor's degree in Psychology with Education from UCL.
